# PyTorch CNN Trainer

- Note that this PyPi package is no longer maintained. It will work fine upto this release, but I won't do bug fixes.
- The entire code and API is migrated to [Quickvison](https://github.com/Quick-AI/quickvision), it has similar API and is maintained actively.

## Train CNN for your task

A simple engine to fine tune CNNs from [torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision) and [Pytorch Image models](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) from Ross Wightman.

## Why This Package ?

It is very annoying to write training loop and training code for CNN training. Also to support all the training features it takes massive time.

Usually we don't need distributed training and it is very uncomfortable to use argparse and get the job done.

This simplifies the training. It provide you a powerful `engine.py` which can do lot of training functionalities. 
Also a `dataset.py` to load dataset in common scenarios.

Note: - 
Pytorch Trainer is not a distributed training script.

It will work good for single GPU machine for Google Colab / Kaggle.

But for distributed Training you can use the PyTorch Lightning Trainer (soon). 

It will train on multiple GPUs just the way lightning supports (soon).

## To install 

Install torch and torchvision from [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
Run the following in terminal.

```
pip install -q git+git://github.com/oke-aditya/pytorch_cnn_trainer.git
```
Or from PyPI now !!

```
pip install pytorch_cnn_trainer
```
